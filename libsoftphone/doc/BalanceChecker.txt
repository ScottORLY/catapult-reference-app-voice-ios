Libsoftphone - Balance check web service


Introduction
============

Libsoftphone calls the Balance Checker periodically to obtain current credit balance for a SIP (or XMPP) account. The web service is typically implemented by VoIP service provider, who has access to the user database and billing backend and can provide this information. The interval between the calls is configurable via Account XML, the web service is also checked specially after a call is terminated and immediately after successful registration, to have the most up-to-date balance available at the moments when it's expected to change.


Web service protocol
====================

The preferred way to check for the balance is by HTTPS POST request with parameters encoded using the common "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format and getting a response formatted as a simple XML document. Alternatively, we can also support SOAP web services or any other well-documented format, but the experience shows that HTTPS POST does the job well and is easiest to implement.

Example request:
================

Below is an example request, which should be quite self-explanatory. In our case, we pass username&password parameters to authorize the access to account balance.

POST /balance HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Acrobits Libsoftphone/1234 
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: length

username=49800123456&password=top%20secret


Example response
================

We recommend passing a "result" variable, which indicates whether the request succeeded. The balance is shown to the user only if the value is 0, other values are logged in the traffic log where they can be used for troubleshooting.

We further recommend to do the formatting of the balance on the server, because of the complications with currency symbol position, decimal point separators etc. The balance will always be shown exactly as it is in the "balanceString" node. 

The nodes "balance" and "currency" are added for the sake of completeness, they are usually not used.
